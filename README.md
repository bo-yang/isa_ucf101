ISA code for action recognition with UCF 101

The ISA code is modified based on Quoc Le's ISA network, which can be downloaded from: http://ai.stanford.edu/~quocle/video_release.tar.gz. 

For theoretical introduction about this project, please refer to [Action Recognition with Fisher Vectors](http://www.bo-yang.net/2014/04/30/fisher-vector-in-action-recognition) and [DTF Notes](http://www.bo-yang.net/2014/01/10/dense-trajectory-notes) on [my blog](http://bo-yang.github.io).
